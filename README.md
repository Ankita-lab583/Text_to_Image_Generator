# Text_to_Image_Generator


I developed a script using the `StableDiffusionPipeline` from the `diffusers` library to generate images with a specific prompt. The model runs on a CUDA-enabled device, with parameters such as seed, number of inference steps, image size, and guidance scale. I successfully generated an image based on the prompt "two trains" and displayed it using `matplotlib`.
